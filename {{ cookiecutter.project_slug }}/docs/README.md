# Documentation

This project documentation is organized into two core tracks:

- [`engineering/`](./engineering/README.md): delivery standards and review workflow.
- [`adr/`](./adr/README.md): architecture decision records for long-term technical choices.

## Usage

- Start from engineering guardrails before implementation and review.
- Create or update an ADR whenever architecture or structure decisions change.
